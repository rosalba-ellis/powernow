The problem with the concept of power is that no Secretary of State or Minster has responsibility for it. No government official is given the task of devising a new statecraft for the administration. The voters aren’t demanding it on the doorstep and the media won't be scrutinising the government's performance based on how a government uses its power. 

But the ability to govern in ways that are aligned to their times is critical.  From Labour’s Morrisonian national ownership in 1945 to New Labour’s renewed New Public Management in 1997 or Thatcher’s model of commercialisation in 1979, administrations have always adapted how they use and practise power depending on what is possible at the time. With the emergence of “new power”, the question of how a future government should govern becomes all the more important.  

This publication wades into the deep and fast-moving currents of how we decide and do things for progressive ends in the 21st Century. It is difficult terrain because it is complex and cultural. But it is essential terrain to conquer if Labour wants not to just win office fleetingly, but govern effectively, over a long period of time, change the county for the better and leave a lasting legacy.

The great benefit we have is that Labour administrations from countries to councils are not waiting for a Labour government. Neither are many cutting-edge business and civil society organisations. They are already showing the way, building new forms of power and inspiring us. The role of a future Labour government, or Labour-led government, is to support, embed and systemise these new ways of using and developing power. 

Labour will only succeed in office if it develops a new approach to governing relevant to the 21st Century. This publication starts the debate about why and how this might be done.

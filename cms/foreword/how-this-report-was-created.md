Labour Together has spent the last 3 years, creating spaces for people from different traditions within our movement to have difficult but necessary political conversations face-to-face with people they might not ordinarily speak with. We’ve convened events, run projects and created a network to bring new ideas into our politics. We are a space within the Labour movement for all of us to step forward, to be heard and to listen together. Our General Election Review is a culmination of this work, bridging the divides within our party by bringing together **15 Commissioners from across our movement** to explore our general election loss.

We intentionally designed our review so that our whole movement can feel part of it, because the process of constructing a project that involves all our traditions is as important as what we conclude. Our analysis is drawn from the combined insights from **over 11,000** **survey responses** from our members, supporters, and former voters on their views and experience of the campaign (**covering 638/650 constituencies**), alongside more than **50 in depth interviews** with activists, organisers and party staff, Labour candidates and MEPs across the UK. It is supported by **submissions from groups across the movement** including Momentum, Progress, Labour Business, English Labour Network, a Labour LGA councillors’ survey, Labour’s Community Organising Unit and our affiliated Trade Unions

To construct a foundational analysis of the 2019 general election, we commissioned work from **data analysis firm Datapraxis**, making use of exclusive access to a **YouGov dataset of private polling responses from almost 240,000 people** during the 2019 general election. This was combined with early analysis from the **British Election Study** to identify both the long term and short-term factors at play in this election for Part One of our report. Our analysis of Labour’s campaign in Part Two is supported by independent research and reviews of Labour’s strategy and campaign organisation, which we commissioned from research firm **The Campaign Company** and expert digital consultants **Valent Projects, Common Knowledge and the Centre for Countering Digital Hate**. Part Three of our review which lays out the way ahead, draws on further quantitative analysis provided by **Datapraxis** and a ground-breaking deliberative [Citizens’ Panel](https://youtu.be/Vbldo27ocwg) which we commissioned from **research firm Britain Thinks** that brought together voters from groups which are crucial to the formation of a winning electoral coalition.

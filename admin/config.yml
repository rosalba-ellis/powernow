              into working longer and harder — and sometimes at hours and
              locations that are less lucrative for them. To keep drivers on the
              road, the company has exploited some people’s tendency to set
              earnings goals — alerting them that they are ever so close to
              hitting a precious target when they try to log off. It has even
              concocted an algorithm similar to a Netflix feature that
              automatically loads the next program, which many experts believe
              encourages binge-watching. In Uber’s case, this means sending
              drivers their next fare opportunity before their current ride is
              even over. And most of this happens without giving off a whiff of
              coercion.”, key: -40376fc1

              Original text: James Farrar, a union organiser for Uber drivers,
              has taken Uber to court over a failure to disclose records of
              drivers’ trips and their compensation. Farrar wants to make the
              algorithm used to manage drivers more accountable. He has set up
              the Worker Info Exchange which is exploring how to set up a data
              trust for drivers to collect information about their pay for the
              purpose of collective bargaining. Farrar is campaigning for the
              establishment of an API (an intermediary software that allows two
              applications to talk to each other) to allow drivers to choose to
              share their records with other drivers so they can compare.
              Currently, says Farrar, Uber is not disclosing worker data in a
              consistent way meaning “99.9% of drivers are fobbed off with
              little or no proper access to data or explanation of the
              algorithm”., key: 79563edf

              became a space for them to congregate. Then people offering jobs
              started to recruit from the group. The group instituted their own
              minimum wage, which began in 2015 as £10 per hour. Since then it
              has been set at £11 per hour and £12 per hour for London. The

              space for the local area. Outreach has included mapping exercises,
              alcohol-free beer tasting, designing pub signs, creating a menu of

              models of support which bring people together in real

              together in support relationships, both able to give something to
              each other, rather than seeing the relationship as one-way. While
              it is a ‘proper’ service, regulated by the CQC, so that support is
              there when needed, these living relationships don’t feel like
              someone is ‘administering a service’ to someone else, they create
              a model that offers the best of both worlds, including care, love
              and friendship. Alex Fox of Shared Lives asks us to stop thinking
              of institutions which step in when things ‘fail’ but rather to see
              support services as a relationship which many of us will need at
              some time in our lives. “Instead of a whole host of brief
              transactions with people who have power over us, we can begin to
              co-create a smaller number of deeper, longer relationships”., key:

The government has also been able to issue more than 100 million biometric, microchip-embedded, smart national identity cards to its citizens, which is one of the highest volumes in the world. Through the A2i programme they have also created a network of over 6500 Digital Centres across the country which provide a one-stop source of information and government services.

              "instance" owners inadvertently adding toxic content and users to
              their server nodes. And Rochko himself encouraged users to
              pre-emptively block GAB's "instance," resulting in ever fewer

              Original text: The idea is to coordinate the research jointly and
              then share the insights and learnings across the network. A recent
              policy lab, which was approved, focuses on how councils can
              implement neighbourhood level, participation led interventions
              that will help them achieve their net zero environmental targets.
              The idea is to collate all the current initiatives being done,
              explore their impact and then create a toolkit of possible
              interventions which have worked. The council officers, community
              groups and councillors can then use this toolkit to work out what
              has worked before and what might be best for their area. The whole
              project is focused on increasing democracy and participation in
              designing longer term interventions to tackle climate change. The
              project, led by Kirklees Council, also involves 9 partner councils

              who quit his job to make a radical break with centrally managed
              home care and create Buurtzorg, a patient-centred alternative.
              Shifting decision-making to the frontline and avoiding all forms
              of central management, Buurtzorg's nursing teams were empowered to
              integrate families and neighbourhood organisations in holistic
              solutions for their clients. Using this approach, the social
              enterprise was successful in creating a more financially

              prevents rejection by MPs of clicktivism. And by focusing efforts
              on people with the postcode of a powerful MP, the campaigning
              makes the most of limited resources and empowers citizens. By

              rebellion efforts in Westminster, the activism can be even more
              effective. And by planning ahead and organising in the
